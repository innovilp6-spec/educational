Chapter 2: Introduction to JavaScript Variables
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. One of the most important concepts in JavaScript is the variable. A variable is used to store data that can be used and changed later in a program.

What is a Variable?
A variable is a container for storing values. These values can be numbers, text, or more complex data. Each variable has a name and a value.For example, if we want to store a user’s age, we can create a variable called age and assign a number to it.

Declaring Variables in JavaScript
JavaScript provides three main keywords to declare variables:
- var
- let
- const

Using let: The let keyword is recommended in modern JavaScript. Variables declared with let can be updated but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
Using const: The const keyword is used for variables whose values should not change. Once assigned, the value of a const variable cannot be updated.

Rules for Naming Variables
Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($)
They cannot start with a number
They are case-sensitive (total and Total are different)
They should be meaningful and easy to understand

Why Variables Are Important
Variables help make programs dynamic and flexible. Instead of writing fixed values, developers use variables to store user input, perform calculations, and control program behavior.
